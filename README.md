# üß† Machine Learning Roadmap

## üöÄ Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is highly in-demand across various industries today.

This file provides a step-by-step guide from beginner to advanced level, including recommended YouTube courses for each topic.
